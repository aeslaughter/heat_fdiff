\section ex1_intro Introduction
The following includes a 1-D finite difference solution of the heat equation including short-wave radiation penetration. The following is an example of how to utilize the classes and functions defined in the library. The complete source code file is provided here: example1.cpp.  

\section ex1_desc Description of Code
\subsection ex1_preamble Preamble
First the necessary header files are loaded, including the necessary standard libraries. Then the necessary PETsc related headers are included as perscribed in the PETsc documentations for each of the functions used. Finally, the headers associated with this library are included, where heat_fdiff.h provides the general functions and the others are used for direct application to snow.

\subsection ex1_main Begin Main Function and User Input
The main function begins with initizining a time variable for documenting the computation time. Then the command line inputs are handled. By default the temperature data produced is saved in output.dat, but the use may include the desired name from the command line as an additional argument (e.g., ./main data.txt).
\snippet example1.cpp main

\subsection ex1_var Define Objects and Variables
Four objects are created, the first three, D, E, and C, are basically storage structures for the necessary parameters need to solve the heat equation for snow (see SnowVar.h). The last object, F, is a Flux object that contains member functions for computing the various flux terms for the snow problem (see Flux.h).

Next, all of the variables used throughout the program are defined, including the necessary PETsc vectors and matrix for performing parallel calculations.

\subsection ex1_build Initilize the PETsc Objects
The PETsc vectors---T, qabs, and bvec---and the stiffness matrix K, must be initilzed. This is accomplished be first initilizing the PETsc package itself, which also initializes MPI. 

The temperature vector has special requirements, thus the function from this library, createWithGhosts, was used (see heat_fdiff.h). The other vectors and K matrix are created in standard fashion with PETsc functions. The stiffness matrix is diagnol sparse matrix, well suited for the MatCreateMPIAIJ function provided with PETsc.

Finally, the temperature vector is set to the constant starting temperature and assembled using the assebleVec function from this library (see heat_fdiff.h).

\subsection ex_output1 Initial Output
Before begining the time loop, the initial temperature vectors is output using the output function from this library (see heat_fdiff.h).
\snippet example1.cpp out1

\subsection ex_loop Begin Time Loop
The temperature for each time step is solved within a loop.
\snippet example1.cpp loop

\subsection ex_snow Compute the Snow Related Terms
The two flux terms, the surface flux qs, and the absorbed flux, qabs are computed as they pertain to a layered snow pack using the Flux object (see Flux.h) supplied with this library. First the absorbed flux is computed for each layer, in parallel, with the qabsorbed member function of the Flux object. This vector is then assembled with PETsc's assembly commands. Finally the surface flux is computed with the qsurface member function of the Flux class. 
\snippet example1.cpp snow

\subsection ex_solve Solve for New Temperatures
Seven steps, in this example are required to solve and record the new temperatures. 
	-# THe vector and matrix coefficients are computed based on the material properties and the numerical time step and layer thickness.
	-# Based on these coefficients and the flux, the vector of knowns (bvec) is updated.
	-# The absorbed flux vector (qabs) is added to the vector of knowns (bvec).
	-# The stiffness matrix, K, is updated.
	-# The linear system is solved using the solve_temp function of this library (see heat_fdiff.h).
	-# The new temperature is outputed to the desired file.
	-# Finally, the temperature array is adjusted not to allow the snow to get above freezing.

\subsection ex_finish Complete the Program
After completing all of the desired time steps within the loop the program is completed by finalize the PETsc package and outputing the computation time.
\snippet example1.cpp finish

\subsection ex_results Example Results
Running this example as is produces the output included in example1.dat. Then using the plotT.m MATLAB function the following contour plot is created from this file, which displays the temperature as a function of depth and time is created.
